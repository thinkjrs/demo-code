# demo-code
A place for me to store code I plan to share in blog posts, articles, and incomplete text books.

Check out my blog, [thinkjrs.dev](https://thinkjrs.dev), or my company's blog, [Slightly Sharpe](https://slightlysharpe.com) for writeups on stuff you find here.

## ðŸ”‹ What's included

- [JSON Encoding Python Classes](https://github.com/thinkjrs/demo-code/tree/main/json-encode-python-classes)
> A simple example of using the `json` module's custom encoder via adding basic iteration to a class.
